# Placeholder file.

FASTA files are _not_ pushed to this repo because they are too large and would violate GISAID sharing agreement. For the code to run, you have to download the GISAID data yourself. Please contact the corresponding author (david.champredon@canada.ca) for any sequence data enquiry.

FASTA files expected have the following format

`[virus]_[source]_[cirORref].fasta`

where:

* `virus` is the influenza subtype i.e., `H1N1`, `H3N2` or `B`
* `source` is the platform from where the FASTA file was downloaded (GISAID, IRD)
* `cirORref`: `cir` for circulating viruses, `ref` for reference genomes (the ones vaccines are based on)
