Computer code associated with:

*"Antigenic drift and epidemiological severity of seasonal influenza in Canada"* by Zishu Chen, Christina Bancej, Liza Lee, David Champredon (david.champredon@canada.ca). 2022. Scientific Reports.  

The R script named `MAIN_SCRIPT.R` is the master script to run the full analysis presented in the paper above.

### WARNING

Some scripts in this folder will not run because the data files are missing. We cannot share some of them publicly (data set of pediatric hospitalizations is not public, and posting the genetic sequences would not comply with GISAID's sharing agreement). 

Hence, the scripts are presented here for *methodological transparency* only. 

Please contact the corresponding author (david.champredon@canada.ca) for any enquiries about this code.
